# fmin
 Minimizes a multivariate function using a Quasi-Newton 
algorithm where the inverse Hessian is updated by BFGS and step size is selected
using a bracketing & quadratic interpolation method. See Nocedal & Wright (2006). 

You can install the package with the command: 

```remotes::install_github("r-glennie/fmin")```
